# MIni_project_BST

This project is about visualizing Binary Search Tree. It is implemented using different primitives available in OpenGL library and combining them together in a required manner. It highlights the key features of Binary Search Tree. This project consists of Binary Search Tree which is constructed by using the concept of Linked Lists. Through this Project one can visualize the working of various features of a Binary Search Tree. Computer Graphics allows the user to visualize the concept of Binary Search Tree very easily. The project illustrates the role of different callback functions that provide easier way to accomplish the project in an effective manner. The project has been implemented by efficiently using the data structure to obtain the optimized results and also various functions and features that are made available by the OpenGL software package have been utilized effectively.
